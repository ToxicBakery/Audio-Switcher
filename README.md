Audio Switcher
==============

One click audio playback switching in Windows 7. Simply open the application and click the playback device you want to use. The application will launch the Windows Sound manager, select the playback device, set it as default, and finally close the manager and itself.

I hope to update this further in the future so hotkeys can be set or maybe even desktop icons that will make this process even quicker.
